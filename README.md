# NanoTrade Algorithm

## Overview
**NanoTrade Algorithm** is a **high-performance algorithmic trading backtester** designed for **low-latency strategy execution and quantitative finance research**. It integrates **real-time data acquisition, technical indicators, and advanced backtesting capabilities** to help traders evaluate and optimize their strategies.

## Features
âœ… **Live Data Download:** Uses **libcurl** to fetch historical data from Yahoo Finance.  
âœ… **Technical Indicators:** Supports **Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Momentum, and Relative Strength Index (RSI)**.  
âœ… **Performance Metrics:** Computes **PnL (Profit and Loss), Max Drawdown, and Sharpe Ratio**.  
âœ… **Low-Latency Execution:** Designed for **speed and efficiency**, enabling rapid strategy evaluation.  
âœ… **CMake Build System:** Easily buildable on **Linux/macOS/Windows**.  
âœ… **CSV Parsing:** Converts downloaded CSV data into structured price data for analysis.

## How I Built It
The development of **NanoTrade Algorithm** followed a structured approach:
1. **Project Initialization:**
   - Set up **CMake** for project compilation.
   - Created a modular project structure with `src/` containing different components.

2. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Implemented a **Downloader module** using `libcurl` to fetch historical data from Yahoo Finance.
   - Designed a **CSV parsing system** to clean and structure price data for analysis.

3. **Technical Indicators Implementation:**
   - Developed **SMA (Simple Moving Average)** to smooth price trends.
   - Added **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** to give more weight to recent price changes.
   - Implemented **Momentum Indicator** to detect market trends.
   - Built **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** to identify overbought/oversold conditions.

4. **Backtesting System:**
   - Designed a **Backtester module** that runs different strategies on historical data.
   - Evaluated **PnL, Max Drawdown, and Sharpe Ratio** for performance assessment.
   - Implemented **logging and output analysis** for better insights.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Improved execution speed with **efficient memory management**.
   - Ensured scalability for **multi-asset backtesting**.
   - Refactored code for **cleaner, more modular design**.

6. **Testing & Debugging:**
   - Verified strategy performance with **sample stock data (AAPL, BTC-USD, etc.)**.
   - Debugged memory leaks and execution bottlenecks.
   - Benchmarked execution time for further improvements.

7. **Final Deployment & Documentation:**
   - Packaged the project into a **structured repository** for easy installation.
   - Created this **README file** to guide users through installation and usage.

## Build & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **GCC/G++ (C++17 or later)**
- **CMake**
- **libcurl (for HTTP requests)**

#### Install libcurl (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

### Compilation Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adriantrill/NanoTradeAlgorithm.git
cd NanoTradeAlgorithm
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running the Trading Simulator
```bash
./NanoTradeAlgorithm
```

### Expected Output
```bash
Downloading data for AAPL...
Downloaded 252 rows.

=== SMA Crossover Strategy ===
Final PnL:      1234.56
Max Drawdown:   5.32%
Daily Sharpe:   1.23

=== Momentum Strategy ===
Final PnL:      890.12
Max Drawdown:   4.78%
Daily Sharpe:   1.10
```

## Technical Indicators Implemented
This project includes multiple technical indicators for backtesting trading strategies:

### **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
- Computes the average closing price over a specified period.
- Helps identify trends in market price movements.

### **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
- Gives more weight to recent prices for a more responsive trend indicator.
- Uses a smoothing factor **Î± = 2 / (period + 1)**.

### **Momentum Indicator**
- Measures the rate of price change over a given period.
- Formula: `Momentum = Current Price - Price N periods ago`.

### **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
- Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.
- Uses a 14-day default period and calculates the average gain/loss.
- RSI values range from **0 to 100**, with values above 70 considered **overbought** and below 30 considered **oversold**.

## Future Enhancements
- ðŸ“Š **More Trading Strategies (MACD, Bollinger Bands, RSI Enhancements, etc.)**
- ðŸš€ **Multithreaded execution for performance boost.**
- ðŸ”„ **Integration with live market data feeds.**
- ðŸ§  **Machine Learning-based predictive trading models.**
